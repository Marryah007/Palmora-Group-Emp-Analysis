# Palmora HR Analysis

## Project Objective
To examine the HR data of Palmora Group Emp Data to identify potential areas of concern within the organization and provide recommendations for management consideration.

## Dataset Used
'<a href="https://github.com/Marryah007/Palmora-Group-Emp-Analysis/blob/main/PROJECT%20REPORT.pbix">'Dataset <a/>

## Questions (KPIs)
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments.

2. Show insights on ratings based on gender. 

3. Analyze the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management

4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 

 ● Does Palmora meet this requirement? 

 ● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:

 ● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.? 

 ● Also visualize this by regions

 ● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
 
 ● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)

 ● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

Here's a breakdown of key methodologies and steps:

### Connection and Transformation:

Clicked the Get Data button or the drop-down arrow to view the full list of available data sources, then selected Text/CSV under the File category.

•	Data Import:
Imported data into Power BI for faster performance, especially for smaller datasets. 

•	Power Query Editor:
This tool was used for data cleaning, transformation, and shaping, including tasks like pivoting, unpivoting, and merging data.

### Data Modeling:

•	Relational Data Model (RDM):
Organized data into tables with relationships between them, enabling efficient data analysis.

### Visualization and Reporting:

•	Report Creation:
This was used to drag-and-drop interface for creating interactive reports and dashboards. 

•	Visualizations:
Include charts, graphs, maps, matrixes, etc. 

•	Interactivity and Navigation:
Reports made interactive with filters, slicers, and drill-through actions. 

### Dashboard Design

Dashboards was used to provide a unified view of essential metrics and insights.




## Process

•	Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.

•	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

•	The questions were asked typically represented using a combination of visualizations.


## Project Insight

Following an analysis of Palmora’s HR data—focusing on gender balance, salary structure, performance ratings, and bonus distribution—I identified key areas for improvement to promote fairness and support more informed decision-making.

Gender was fairly balanced in most regions and departments.

Some departments like Product Management and Human Resources have a higher female presence.

Regional distribution is even across Kaduna, Abuja, and Lagos.

Palmora does NOT fully meet the $90,000 minimum requirement in some departments.
Salary band chart reveals several employees fall below $90K, .
 
Total company-wide pay including bonuses is $71.9M with Lagos taking the lead in pay distribution
